\section{Start Objective}
Our start objective covers what we want to accomplish in the first 4 months of our project. So far we have decided what base dependencies we need.

With 5 members we will split up the work evenly among the features we want to add. At the end of this snapshot we hope to have our base features working, which include the chatbot up/running and integration with Microsoft Teams
To do this we will need to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a Copilot agent in Copilot Studio
\item Create a backend using Microsoft PowerApps
\item Be able to store data in SharePoint Lists and Smartsheet
\item Integrate our Copilot agent with Microsoft Teams
\end{itemize}
